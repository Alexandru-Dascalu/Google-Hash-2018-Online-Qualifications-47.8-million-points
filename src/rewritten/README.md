# Google-Hash-2008-Online-Qualification-Round-Rewritten
A rewritten version of the solution that team Greeper submitted during Google Hash 2018 Qualification Round, getting a score of 22,865,039 points. This code has the same algorithm, but it is rewritten with the data structures and tools that I know, while the original version was written together with a 2nd year student and used things I am not proficient with, such as HashSets, Iterators, etc. This rewritten version also has easier to understand code and is structured better, while getting the same exact score as the original code.
