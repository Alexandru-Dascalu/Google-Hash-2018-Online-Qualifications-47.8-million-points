# Google-Hash-Code-2018-Solution-Original
The original source code Team Greeper used during Hash Code 2018. It was written together with a second year student, and thus it uses things that I am not proficient with. This code is here just for reference and to see how the rewritten version uses the same algorithm, but not HashSets or stuff like that.
On the Google Hash Judge System, this solution got 22865039 points.
