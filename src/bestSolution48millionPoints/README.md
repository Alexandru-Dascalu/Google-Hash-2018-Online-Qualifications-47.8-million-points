# Google-Hash-2018-Online-Qualifications-47.8-million-points
A solution that I developed for the Google Hash 2018 Qualifications Round problem after the competition was over. This solution got  47,871,274 points on the Google Hash Judge System. Had it been submitted during the competition, it would have placed my team in top 5% teams worldwide.
